## Abstract

The community publicly launched the joint proposal NULS to enable the Chinese name "纳世链". Now it has been a public discussion and survey vote for 15 days in the community. It is discussed and operated according to the NIP process, and a standard guidance is given on the use of the NULS name. The community uses the name in accordance with the specifications and displays a unified brand image.



## Motivation

We found that the use of the name of NULS in the community is not uniform and is not conducive to publicity. In order to unify the brand image, let the community correctly use the name of NULS and the logo and other information, according to the proposal of this Chinese name, combined with some existing basic specifications of NULS, propose the NULS name usage specification.
