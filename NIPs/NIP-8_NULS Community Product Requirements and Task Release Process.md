## Preface

NULS is an open source community project. And innovation is the driving force behind the development of open source community projects. The community is both a carrier for the NULS project and a user of the NULS project. Then the product demand must come from the market and users, so I hope to write a process for community product demand collection.



## Abstract

The NULS Community Product Demand and Task Release process demonstrates how a community member can initiate a demand, as well as a process from reporting and evaluating the demand to technology development. 



## Motivation

In order to give full play to the initiative of the community, and stimulate the participation of community members to provide the products that are creative for NULS development and have great significance for the value enhancement and ecological development of NULS. The product manager then evaluates the demands of the community and then add them to the community development.
