# NIPs
NIP stands for NULS Improvement Proposal. A NIP is a design document providing information to the NULS community, and can be used for describing a new feature for NULS or its processes or environment. The NIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.


## Reasons for NIP 

We intend NIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into NULS. Because the NIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

For NULS implementers, NIP is a convenient means to track their progress. Ideally, the maintainers of each feature will list the NIPs they have implemented. This provides a convenient way for users to understand the current status of a feature or library.
